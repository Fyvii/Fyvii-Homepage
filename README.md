Hello! My name is Noor Kahalah. I am a frontend developer/designer focusing on user experience 🖥. I dropped my pursuit of medicine for my true passion in CS! I received a B.S. in Biochemistry 🧬 at the University of New Mexico 🐾. I started out being self-taught until I graduated from NuCamp's React/FrontEnd bootcamp 📚.

Please follow me in my journey as I update my personal portfolio!!! Thank you!
